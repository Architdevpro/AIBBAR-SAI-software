# 🛰️ AIBBAR v2 — Smart Artificial Intelligence (SAI)

**Artificial Intelligence Black Box Activity Recorder (AIBBAR)**  
Developed by **Smart Artificial Intelligence (SAI)**  

---

## 🔍 Overview

**AIBBAR v2** is an advanced system designed to **trace, record, and analyze AI decision-making processes** — similar to a flight recorder for aircraft.  
It allows developers, researchers, and regulators to view **how AI models think, decide, and evolve** in real-time.

Built for transparency, safety, and trust in Artificial Intelligence systems.

## 🧠 Core Concept

AIBBAR acts as an **AI Black Box**, providing an internal look at:
- ✅ AI decision trace logs  
- ✅ Model execution monitoring  
- ✅ Ethical compliance and reasoning audits  
- ✅ Secure data recording and replay  
- ✅ Real-time AI observability dashboards  

Each session is securely logged and auditable, enabling a deep understanding of **what the AI actually did**, not just what it claims it did.
